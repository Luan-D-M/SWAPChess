# SWAPChess

SWAPChess is normal chess with one added rule: the SWAP.

After White's first move, Black has two options: 
1. Play a normal move.
2. Swap: Black mirrors White's move, and White's piece returns to its starting square.

This rule was inspired by the swap rule in the game Hex.

In standard chess, White is known to have a slight first-mover advantage. With the SWAP rule,
White is encouraged to play unusual opening moves so Black doesn't choose to swap.
Although the impact is higher in Hex, applying this rule to chess leads 
to interesting new positions!
